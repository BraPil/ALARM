   - `file-monitor-config.json`: Valid JSON with all required fields

4. **Trigger Processing**
   - Trigger files are created successfully
   - JSON validation works correctly
   - File processing and archiving functional

### **Components with Issues**
1. **GENERATE-TRIGGER.ps1**
   - **Issue**: PowerShell parser errors due to angle brackets in help text
   - **Impact**: Cannot execute trigger generation commands
   - **Workaround**: `SIMPLE-TRIGGER-GENERATOR.ps1` provides same functionality
   - **Status**: Functional workaround available

### **Skipped Components**
1. **GitHub Integration Tests**
   - **Reason**: User requested skip to focus on core functionality
   - **Status**: Can be tested separately if needed
