## Activity Log

### Entry 1: August 30, 2025 - 11:40 PM - Performance Analysis and Baseline
- **Objective:** Identify performance bottlenecks and establish baseline metrics
- **Actions:** 
  - Analyzed current performance-critical components across ALARM system
  - Identified key threshold settings in Pattern Detection and Causal Analysis
  - Examined ML engine performance characteristics
  - Reviewed database query patterns and API response times
  
- **Key Findings:**
  - **Pattern Detection Thresholds:**
    - `MaxClusterCount = 10` (potentially limiting for large datasets)
    - `StreamingWindowSize = 100` (may need adjustment for real-time processing)
    - `MinClusterSizeForPattern = 5` (could be optimized based on data density)
    - `AnomalyThreshold = 0.3` (may need tuning for different data patterns)
    
  - **Causal Analysis Thresholds:**
    - `MinDataPointsForGranger = 30` (could impact analysis speed vs accuracy)
    - `MaxLagForGranger = 5` (balance between thoroughness and performance)
    - `TemporalWindowSize = 50` (memory vs processing trade-off)
    - `MaxSEMIterations = 100` (convergence vs timeout balance)
    
  - **Feedback UI Performance:**
    - `MaxFeedbackLength = 2000` (reasonable limit)
    - API limit defaults to 50 items (could be configurable)
    - Background processing implemented (good architecture)
    
  - **Potential Bottlenecks Identified:**
    - Large clustering operations with high `MaxClusterCount`
    - Sequential pattern mining with long sequences
    - Causal analysis with extensive lag testing
    - Database queries without proper indexing
    - ML model training without caching optimization
