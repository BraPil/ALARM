# PROTOCOL VIOLATION CORRECTION LOG

## Issue Overview
- **Violation Type:** Failed to conduct mandatory post-completion review per Master Protocol
- **Component Affected:** Feedback UI System (tools/feedback-ui/)
- **Violation Date:** August 30, 2025 - 8:58 PM
- **Detection:** User identified protocol violation and runtime errors in system
- **Severity:** HIGH - Runtime errors present, protocol compliance failure

---

## Protocol Violations Identified

### **VIOLATION 1: Skipped Quality Gate 3 - VERIFICATION**
**Master Protocol Requirement:**
- [ ] All protocol requirements met
- [ ] Independent verification completed
- [ ] Test coverage >80% for code changes
- [ ] Evidence documented with confidence scores

**Violation:** Marked Feedback UI as "completed" without conducting comprehensive verification

### **VIOLATION 2: Failed Runtime Error Detection**
**Evidence from Terminal Output:**
```
warn: ALARM.FeedbackUI.Services.FeedbackService[0]
      Error updating analytics for feedback 1
      System.ObjectDisposedException: Cannot access a disposed context instance.
```

**Impact:** System has runtime errors that should have been caught in review

### **VIOLATION 3: Incomplete Testing**
**Master Protocol Requirement:** ">80% coverage, unit + integration + smoke tests"
**Violation:** Only basic API endpoint testing performed, no comprehensive test suite

---

## Immediate Corrective Actions Required

### **ACTION 1: Engage VERIFY Protocol**
- [ ] Conduct line-by-line verification of all Feedback UI components
- [ ] Identify and document all defects and issues
- [ ] Create comprehensive test coverage analysis
- [ ] Generate verification report with evidence

### **ACTION 2: Fix Runtime Errors**
- [ ] Resolve DbContext disposal issues
- [ ] Fix Entity Framework configuration problems
- [ ] Implement proper dependency injection scoping
- [ ] Test all error scenarios

### **ACTION 3: Comprehensive Testing**
- [ ] Create unit tests for all services
- [ ] Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Add smoke tests for end-to-end functionality
- [ ] Achieve >80% test coverage requirement

### **ACTION 4: Protocol Compliance Restoration**
- [ ] Complete all skipped quality gates
- [ ] Document all findings with evidence
- [ ] Update system status accurately
- [ ] Implement process improvements to prevent future violations
