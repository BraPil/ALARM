## Activity Log

### Entry 1: August 30, 2025 - 5:45 PM - Protocol Violation Discovery
- **Objective:** Conduct comprehensive review of ALARM system for accuracy and protocol compliance
- **Actions:** 
  - User correctly identified missing issue logs as protocol violation
  - Analyzed Master Log claims vs actual issue log status
  - Discovered severe outdated tracking (4+ hours behind)
  - Identified workspace contamination with 7 temporary download scripts
- **Results:** 
  - ❌ **CRITICAL VIOLATION:** Missing issue logs for major activities
  - ❌ **CRITICAL VIOLATION:** Severely outdated issue tracking
  - ❌ **PROTOCOL VIOLATION:** Workspace contamination
  - ✅ User correctly identified protocol failures
- **Evidence:** 
  - Master Log line 124 claims non-existent log location
  - Only issue log last updated 1:00 PM (4+ hours behind)
  - 7 temporary download scripts in web-resources directory
- **Lessons:** 
  - Protocol compliance requires continuous issue log maintenance
  - User oversight essential for catching protocol violations
  - Workspace hygiene critical for professional operation
- **Next Steps:** Create missing issue logs and update existing ones

### Entry 2: August 30, 2025 - 5:45 PM - Issue Log Creation and Updates
- **Objective:** Create missing issue logs and update existing ones for complete compliance
- **Actions:**
