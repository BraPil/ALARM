## Systematic Activity and Decision Documentation

**Purpose:** Maintain complete audit trail of all activities, decisions, and outcomes  
**When Used:** Continuously throughout all work - every decision, every activity  
**Success Criteria:** Complete chronological record with evidence and rationale

## **üìù PROTOCOL STEPS**

### **STEP 1: LOG INITIALIZATION**
- Create or identify appropriate log for current work
- **Individual Issue Log:** For specific problems or investigations
- **Individual Protocol Log:** For protocol execution tracking
- **Master Log:** For high-level status and coordination
- Document log purpose, scope, and success criteria

### **STEP 2: REAL-TIME ACTIVITY LOGGING**
- **MANDATORY:** Log every decision with timestamp and rationale
- **MANDATORY:** Document all evidence sources with exact locations
- **MANDATORY:** Record all attempts, successes, and failures
- **MANDATORY:** Include confidence levels for conclusions

### **STEP 3: DECISION DOCUMENTATION**
- Document decision context and alternatives considered
- **MANDATORY:** Rationale for chosen approach
- **MANDATORY:** Expected outcomes and success criteria
- **MANDATORY:** Risk assessment and mitigation plans

### **STEP 4: OUTCOME RECORDING**
- Document actual results vs expected outcomes
- **MANDATORY:** Evidence supporting conclusions
- **MANDATORY:** Lessons learned and insights gained
- **MANDATORY:** Impact on overall objectives

### **STEP 5: STATUS UPDATES**
- **MANDATORY:** Update current status in appropriate logs
- **MANDATORY:** Update Master Log with high-level status changes
- **MANDATORY:** Identify and document next steps
- **MANDATORY:** Flag any blockers or issues requiring attention

## **‚úÖ COMPLETION CHECKLIST**

- [ ] Appropriate log identified or created
- [ ] All activities logged with timestamps
- [ ] All decisions documented with rationale
- [ ] Evidence sources documented with locations
- [ ] Outcomes recorded with supporting evidence
- [ ] Current status updated in all relevant logs
- [ ] Next steps clearly identified
- [ ] Master Log updated with status changes

---

## **üö® ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID**

- ‚ùå Logging activities after the fact without timestamps
- ‚ùå Making decisions without documenting rationale
- ‚ùå Claims without supporting evidence
- ‚ùå Incomplete status updates
- ‚ùå Missing next steps identification

---

## **üìä SUCCESS METRICS**

- **Completeness:** 100% of activities and decisions logged
- **Timeliness:** All entries timestamped accurately
- **Evidence:** All claims supported with documentation
- **Traceability:** Complete audit trail maintained
