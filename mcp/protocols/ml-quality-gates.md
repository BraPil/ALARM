- Resource allocation adjustments

### **GATE 4: STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE**
**Threshold**: 95% confidence level  
**Statistical Tests**:
- T-test for mean comparisons
- Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non-parametric data
- Chi-square test for categorical relationships
- Effect size analysis

**Pass Criteria**:
- Statistical significance achieved (p â‰¤ 0.05)
- Effect size â‰¥ 0.5 (medium effect)
- Power analysis â‰¥ 0.8
- Confidence intervals exclude null hypothesis

**Failure Actions**:
- Require additional data collection
- Increase sample sizes
- Adjust statistical methodology
- Validate experimental design

## ðŸš€ **CI/CD INTEGRATION**

### **GitHub Actions Workflow Integration**
```yaml
# Quality gates triggered on:
- Pull requests to main/develop branches
- Push events to ML model files
- Manual workflow dispatch with custom thresholds
- Scheduled quality validation runs
```

### **Automated Quality Enforcement**
1. **Pre-Deployment Gates**: All quality gates must pass before staging deployment
2. **Production Gates**: Enhanced validation before production deployment
3. **Quality Reporting**: Comprehensive reports generated for each run
4. **PR Comments**: Automated quality status comments on pull requests
5. **Deployment Blocking**: Failed gates automatically block deployments

### **Quality Gate Workflow Sequence**

## ðŸ“Š **QUALITY METRICS AND THRESHOLDS**

### **Configurable Thresholds**
| Metric | Default | Minimum | Recommended |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Accuracy | 85% | 80% | 90% |
| Bias Score | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.05 |
| Performance | 80% | 70% | 85% |
| Statistical Significance | 0.05 | 0.1 | 0.01 |

### **Quality Score Calculation**
```
Overall Quality Score = (Accuracy Ã— 0.4) + ((1 - Bias) Ã— 0.3) + (Performance Ã— 0.3)

Where:
- Accuracy: 0.0 to 1.0
- Bias: 0.0 to 1.0 (lower is better)
- Performance: 0.0 to 1.0
```

### **Quality Classifications**
- **Excellent**: â‰¥90% overall score
- **Good**: 85-89% overall score
- **Acceptable**: 80-84% overall score
- **Needs Improvement**: <80% overall score

## ðŸ”§ **QUALITY GATE CONFIGURATION**

### **Environment Variables**
```yaml
ACCURACY_TARGET: "0.85"      # Minimum accuracy threshold
BIAS_THRESHOLD: "0.1"        # Maximum bias threshold
PERFORMANCE_TARGET: "0.8"    # Minimum performance threshold
CONFIDENCE_LEVEL: "0.95"     # Statistical confidence level
```

### **Custom Threshold Override**
Quality gates support runtime threshold configuration:
```bash
# Custom accuracy threshold
dotnet run --accuracy-threshold 0.90

# Custom bias threshold
dotnet run --bias-threshold 0.05
