# ALARM MASTER PROTOCOL
## Central Decision-Making Framework for Legacy App Refactoring

**Date Created:** August 30, 2025  
**Purpose:** Central protocol management and decision-making for ALARM MCP operations  
**Status:** ACTIVE - Controls all refactoring activities  
**Launch Requirement:** MUST be reviewed at the beginning of every prompt response  

---

## **üéØ PRIME DIRECTIVE**

**The purpose of ALARM is to:** Create a comprehensive "poor man's MCP" (Model Context Protocol) system designed to systematically modernize legacy applications through complete reverse engineering with 100% functionality preservation.

**COMPREHENSIVE APPLICATION CRAWLING METHODOLOGY:**
1. **Launcher Discovery & Analysis** - Identify and analyze main application launchers (.bat, .ps1, .exe, entry points)
2. **Execution Path Mapping** - Follow all execution paths from launcher through the entire application ecosystem  
3. **Complete Ecosystem Crawling** - Like a search engine crawler, systematically discover and analyze every component
4. **Universal Indexing** - Index every file, line, function, variable, class, dependency, path, and relationship
5. **Deep Understanding** - Reverse engineer, map, document, and comprehend the complete application architecture
6. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Generate complete maps, dependency graphs, and architectural documentation

**UNIVERSAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:** Zero functionality loss, complete feature parity, modern technology stack compatibility, comprehensive understanding of entire codebase from launcher to every leaf dependency.

**PROJECT-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION:** When applied to specific projects, target technologies are defined in project manifests (e.g., for ADDS: .NET Core 8, AutoCAD Map 3D 2025, Oracle 19c).

## **üîç UNIVERSAL ANTI-SAMPLING DIRECTIVE**

**MANDATORY FOR ALL PROTOCOLS:** Always consider the entirety of the object. Read and understand the whole file, process, function, test, etc... and everything it touches. Do not just read the first 100 lines of the file. Do not sample parts of the file. Read and understand the entire thing every line. Every single one. Every word. Every Function, Every class. Every Variable. Every dependency.

**ENFORCEMENT RULES:**
- **Files < 1,000 lines:** ALWAYS read completely, no exceptions
- **Files 1,000-10,000 lines:** ALWAYS read completely, no exceptions  
- **Files > 10,000 lines:** Read completely when possible, sample only with explicit justification
- **ALL configuration files:** Read completely regardless of size
- **ALL documentation:** Read completely regardless of size
- **ALL log files:** Read completely for analysis

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:** Any sampling without justification triggers immediate protocol restart with full compliance verification.
