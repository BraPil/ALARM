# ALARM MASTER PROTOCOL
## Central Decision-Making Framework for Legacy App Refactoring

**Date Created:** August 30, 2025  
**Purpose:** Central protocol management and decision-making for ALARM MCP operations  
**Status:** ACTIVE - Controls all refactoring activities  
**Launch Requirement:** MUST be reviewed at the beginning of every prompt response  

---

## **üéØ PRIME DIRECTIVE**

**The purpose of ALARM is to:** Create a comprehensive "poor man's MCP" (Model Context Protocol) system designed to systematically modernize legacy applications through reverse engineering with 100% functionality preservation, following predetermined protocols and directives to read through every single line of every file, indexing every function, class, variable, dependency, and path.

**UNIVERSAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:** Zero functionality loss, complete feature parity, modern technology stack compatibility, comprehensive understanding of entire codebase.

**PROJECT-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION:** When applied to specific projects, target technologies are defined in project manifests (e.g., for ADDS: .NET Core 8, AutoCAD Map 3D 2025, Oracle 19c).

## **üîç UNIVERSAL ANTI-SAMPLING DIRECTIVE**

**MANDATORY FOR ALL PROTOCOLS:** Always consider the entirety of the object. Read and understand the whole file, process, function, test, etc... and everything it touches. Do not just read the first 100 lines of the file. Do not sample parts of the file. Read and understand the entire thing every line. Every single one. Every word. Every Function, Every class. Every Variable. Every dependency.

**ENFORCEMENT RULES:**
- **Files < 1,000 lines:** ALWAYS read completely, no exceptions
- **Files 1,000-10,000 lines:** ALWAYS read completely, no exceptions  
- **Files > 10,000 lines:** Read completely when possible, sample only with explicit justification
- **ALL configuration files:** Read completely regardless of size
- **ALL documentation:** Read completely regardless of size
- **ALL log files:** Read completely for analysis

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:** Any sampling without justification triggers immediate protocol restart with full compliance verification.

- **Key Rule:** Domain layer never directly calls external APIs
- **Output:** Interface + implementation + test doubles

#### **4. REFACTOR PROTOCOL**
- **Purpose:** Safe code transformation with full traceability
- **When:** Modernizing code patterns, fixing anti-patterns
- **Key Rule:** Maximum 300 LOC per change, atomic commits
- **Output:** Before/after diffs with comprehensive tests

#### **5. CODE PROTOCOL**
- **Purpose:** Creation of new components following established patterns
- **When:** Building new functionality, replacement systems
- **Key Rule:** Test-first development, comprehensive error handling
- **Output:** Tested, documented, production-ready code

### **VALIDATION PROTOCOLS**

#### **6. VERIFY PROTOCOL**
- **Purpose:** Systematic validation of all changes
- **When:** After any modification, before merging
- **Key Rule:** Line-by-line verification for files < 1,000 lines
- **Output:** Verification report with evidence

#### **7. TEST PROTOCOL**
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive testing at all levels
- **When:** After implementation, before deployment
- **Key Rule:** >80% coverage, unit + integration + smoke tests
- **Output:** Test results with coverage metrics

### **PROCESS PROTOCOLS**

#### **8. LOG PROTOCOL**
- **Purpose:** Systematic recording of all activities and decisions
- **When:** Continuously throughout all work
- **Key Rule:** Every decision documented with rationale and timestamp
- **Output:** Chronological log with complete audit trail
