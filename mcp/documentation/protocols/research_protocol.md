# RESEARCH PROTOCOL
## Comprehensive Investigation and Evidence Gathering

**Purpose:** Systematic investigation to identify root causes and collect complete evidence  
**When Used:** Error investigation, dependency analysis, unknown system behavior  
**Success Criteria:** Complete evidence with sources, verified root causes, actionable findings  

---

## **üîç PROTOCOL STEPS**

### **STEP 1: SCOPE DEFINITION**
- Define investigation boundaries and objectives
- Identify all potential evidence sources
- Establish success criteria and completion requirements
- Document investigation plan with timeline

### **STEP 2: EVIDENCE COLLECTION**
- **MANDATORY:** Read all relevant files completely (NO sampling < 10,000 lines)
- **MANDATORY:** Document every source with exact location and timestamp
- **MANDATORY:** Capture complete context, not excerpts
- **MANDATORY:** Verify evidence authenticity and relevance

### **STEP 3: PATTERN ANALYSIS**
- Identify recurring themes across evidence
- Cross-reference findings between sources
- Document patterns with supporting evidence
- Quantify pattern frequency and significance

### **STEP 4: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFICATION**
- Apply systematic root cause analysis (5 Whys, Fishbone)
- Distinguish between symptoms and actual causes
- Validate causes against all collected evidence
- Rank causes by impact and likelihood

### **STEP 5: FINDINGS SYNTHESIS**
- Compile comprehensive findings report
- Include all evidence with sources
- Document confidence levels for each finding
- Provide actionable recommendations

## **üö® ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID**

- ‚ùå Sampling files without reading completely
- ‚ùå Making assumptions without evidence
- ‚ùå Stopping at first apparent cause
- ‚ùå Ignoring contradictory evidence
- ‚ùå Conclusions without confidence scoring
