## Activity Log

### Entry 1: August 30, 2025 - 12:30 PM - Gap Analysis and System Design
- **Objective:** Analyze current ALARM system vs ADDS Master Protocol to identify gaps
- **Actions:** 
  - Comprehensive comparison of ALARM vs ADDS protocol systems
  - Identified 8 critical gaps requiring immediate attention
  - Designed laser-focused approach eliminating bloat from ADDS system
- **Results:** 
  - ✅ Gap analysis complete with detailed comparison table
  - ✅ System design approach agreed upon with user
  - ✅ Focus on essential, brilliant protocols without repetition
- **Evidence:** 
  - Detailed gap analysis in conversation history
  - User approval for thoughtful, focused approach
  - Comparison table showing current vs required components
- **Lessons:** 
  - ADDS system had some bloat that should be eliminated
  - Master Protocol system is critical for systematic approach
  - Quality gates and anti-sampling are essential for success
- **Next Steps:** Create Master Protocol and Master Log documents

### Entry 2: August 30, 2025 - 12:45 PM - Master Protocol and Master Log Creation
- **Objective:** Create laser-focused Master Protocol document and Master Log system
- **Actions:**
  - Created `mcp/protocols/master_protocol.md` with 8 protocols and 4 quality gates
  - Created `mcp_runs/master_log.md` with protocol tracking and status monitoring
  - Eliminated bloat while maintaining essential systematic approach
  - Included anti-sampling enforcement and quality gate system
- **Results:**
  - ✅ Master Protocol document complete with protocol selection matrix
  - ✅ Master Log system operational with status tracking
  - ✅ 8 protocols defined: Research, Pattern, Adapt, Refactor, Code, Verify, Test, Log
  - ✅ 4 quality gates implemented with mandatory checkpoints
- **Evidence:**
  - `mcp/protocols/master_protocol.md` - 150 lines, focused and actionable
  - `mcp_runs/master_log.md` - Comprehensive status tracking system
  - Protocol selection matrix for different scenarios
- **Lessons:**
  - Focused approach much cleaner than original ADDS bloated version
  - Quality gates provide essential systematic checkpoints
  - Master Log coordination critical for complex systems
- **Next Steps:** Create individual protocol documents

### Entry 3: August 30, 2025 - 1:00 PM - Individual Protocol Creation
- **Objective:** Create laser-focused individual protocol documents
- **Actions:**
  - Created Research Protocol for comprehensive investigation
  - Created Adapt Protocol for external dependency isolation  
  - Created Verify Protocol for systematic validation
  - Created Log Protocol for activity documentation
  - Each protocol focused on essential steps without bloat
- **Results:**
  - ✅ Research Protocol complete with anti-sampling enforcement
  - ✅ Adapt Protocol complete with clean architecture requirements
  - ✅ Verify Protocol complete with evidence requirements
  - ✅ Log Protocol complete with systematic documentation approach
- **Evidence:**
  - `mcp/protocols/research_protocol.md` - Focused investigation approach
  - `mcp/protocols/adapt_protocol.md` - Clean dependency isolation
  - `mcp/protocols/verify_protocol.md` - Systematic validation approach
  - `mcp/protocols/log_protocol.md` - Complete documentation system
- **Lessons:**
  - Individual protocols much more actionable when focused
  - Step-by-step approach with checklists essential
  - Anti-patterns section helps prevent common mistakes
- **Next Steps:** Complete remaining protocols and integrate with existing system

## Current Status
- **Overall Status:** IN PROGRESS - Core protocols created, integration pending
- **Completion:** 60% - Master framework complete, individual protocols 50% complete
- **Blockers:** None - proceeding systematically
- **Next Actions:** 
  1. Complete remaining individual protocols (Pattern, Refactor, Code, Test)
  2. Integrate Master Protocol with existing MCP directive system
  3. Update tools to enforce anti-sampling requirements
  4. Test protocol selection matrix with real scenarios
