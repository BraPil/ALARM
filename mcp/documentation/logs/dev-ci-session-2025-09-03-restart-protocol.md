# ADDS25 Development CI Session Log - Restart Protocol Engagement
**Date**: 2025-09-03  
**Time**: 17:30 ET (Test Computer: 16:30 CT)  
**Session Type**: Named Pipes Corruption Recovery  
**Protocol Status**: RESTART PROTOCOL ENGAGED  

## Session Overview
Development session focused on Named Pipes system validation and corruption recovery for ADDS 2025 project.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Named Pipes Server Corruption
**Issue**: Server running in zombie state with corrupted timestamp  
**Timestamp**: 12/31/1600 7:00 PM (invalid system date)  
**Symptoms**: 
- Client connections fail with "Access to the path is denied"
- Server appears running but non-functional
- Pipe exists in namespace but inaccessible

### 2. Protocol Violation Acknowledgment
**Violation**: Insufficient real-time documentation and logging  
**Impact**: Session state not properly tracked  
**Resolution**: Immediate documentation recovery initiated  

## System State Analysis

### PowerShell Process Status
- **Total Processes**: 6 PowerShell instances
- **Named Pipes Server**: PID 36260 (started 5:09:38 PM)
- **Development Terminal**: PID 39848 (started 5:24:49 PM)
- **Status**: Multiple instances, potential conflicts

### Named Pipes Namespace
- **Pipe Name**: ADDS25-CURSOR-ANALYSIS-PIPE
- **Status**: Corrupted with invalid timestamp
- **Access**: Blocked by security permissions
- **Cleanup**: Manual removal failed

## Restart Protocol Execution

### Phase 1: Pre-Restart Preparation ‚úÖ
- [x] Current state documented
- [x] Work preservation confirmed (commit 25c31a1)
- [x] Protocol violation acknowledged
- [x] Recovery plan defined

### Phase 2: System Restart Execution üîÑ
- [ ] PowerShell windows closed
- [ ] System restart initiated
- [ ] Corrupted pipes cleared

### Phase 3: Post-Restart Recovery üìã
- [ ] Fresh admin PowerShell windows opened
- [ ] Named Pipes server restarted
- [ ] System validation completed

## Error Resolution Documentation

### Named Pipes Permission Issues
**Root Cause**: Server corruption with invalid security descriptor  
**Symptoms**: "Access to the path is denied" errors  
**Attempted Solutions**:
1. Administrator privilege verification ‚úÖ
2. Server restart with fresh privileges ‚ùå
3. Manual pipe cleanup ‚ùå
4. System restart protocol üîÑ

### Multiple Instance Conflicts
**Issue**: Multiple Named Pipes servers running  
**Resolution**: Complete system restart to clear all instances  
**Prevention**: Single server instance policy enforced  

## Protocol Compliance Status

### Master Protocol Requirements
- [x] ALARM Prime Directive: Engaged
- [x] ADDS 2025 Project Directive: Active
- [x] Sub-Directives: All 3 active
- [x] Concurrent Monitoring: Active

### Documentation Requirements
- [x] Session logging: Initiated
- [x] Error documentation: Completed
- [x] Protocol compliance: Acknowledged
- [x] Recovery procedures: Documented

## Next Steps Post-Restart

### Immediate Actions
1. **Verify Named Pipes cleanup**: Check for clean namespace
2. **Fresh server startup**: Single instance with proper permissions
3. **Client connection test**: Validate real-time communication
4. **System integration test**: Full Named Pipes functionality

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Named Pipes server running with current timestamp
- [ ] Client connections successful
- [ ] Real-time analysis triggering operational
- [ ] No permission or access errors

## Time Zone Considerations

### System Time Synchronization
- **Dev Computer**: Eastern Time (ET)
- **Test Computer**: Central Time (CT) - 1 hour behind
- **Impact**: Test results timestamp adjustments required
- **Monitoring**: Time zone aware analysis implemented
