🚀 LAUNCHER FILE IDENTIFICATION
===============================
ALARM will start analysis from the main launcher file and crawl all dependencies.

Detected potential launcher files:
1. ✅ ADDS_Main.exe (Confidence: 95%) - Primary application executable
2. ✅ StartADDS.bat (Confidence: 85%) - Batch launcher script  
3. ✅ ADDS.sln (Confidence: 90%) - Visual Studio solution
4. ⚠️  Setup.exe (Confidence: 60%) - Installation executable

Select launcher file: [1] ADDS_Main.exe
> 1

✅ Launcher selected: ADDS_Main.exe
   - Entry point identified: Main() method
   - Initial dependencies detected: 23 assemblies
   - Ready to begin comprehensive crawling
```

### **Step E: Comprehensive Analysis and Crawling**
**System Action:** ALARM performs complete ecosystem analysis
**Process Flow:**
1. **Initial Launcher Analysis**
   - Read, index, map launcher file completely
   - Identify all direct dependencies, imports, references
   - Map function calls, class instantiations, variable usage
   
2. **Dependency Discovery and Prioritization**
   - Create prioritized list of next files to analyze
   - Rank by criticality, usage frequency, and dependency depth
   - Queue files for systematic analysis
   
3. **Iterative Crawling Process**
   - Analyze each queued file completely (every line, function, class, variable)
   - Discover new dependencies from each analyzed file
   - Update priority queue with newly discovered files
   - Continue until 100% of application ecosystem is mapped
   
4. **Comprehensive Indexing**
   - Create complete application map with all relationships
   - Index every function, class, variable, dependency
   - Map data flow, control flow, and integration points
   - Document architecture patterns and business logic

**Expected Experience:**
